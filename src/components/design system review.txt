The Design Standards document is great, very useful info and tools.
For the most part, I think the component pages have enough direction for now.

I built out some of our tailwind theme based on the breakpoints and colors, and there were a couple of things I was confused about.
 - On the Colors page, the body-color says Gray 900 but is blue, so I wasn't sure which was intended.
 - On the Design Standards document, Secondary is blue, but on the colors page it is gray. Which is correct?

Are we not supporting dark mode right now?



Action panels
    At what breakpoint should we switch from mobile to desktop?
    When would we use simple well vs simple?
Alerts
    What is the utility bar vs the header (see Placement)
Badges
    I've never seen a square badge. Actions the customer can take?
Banners
    Do these go in the same area as alerts?
Buttons
    Circle buttons (eg profile button) should use secondary styling?
Breadcrumbs
    When should we use filled or not filled?
Checkboxes
    Checkbox on left vs right?
Containers
    Not sure how to use these
Description Lists
    Remove button is slightly cut off in the top left example attachments panel
Dividers
    Not sure how to use these either. Examples?
Feeds
    Bottom right "commented" icon, is that a square badge?
Form layouts
    Would the vertical navigation be inside the content area?
Text area
    Resizable?3
